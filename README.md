# sigman
Sigman, shorthand for sigma notation, is a newly created project for calculating a sigma summation notation formula.

## DISCLAIMER - NOT PRODUCTION QUALITY CODE
This project is still in an early state.&nbsp; There are only a few tests written, and it only uses JavaScript built-in data types meaning that large values or functions involving fractional division might cause unexpected results.
