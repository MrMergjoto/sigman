# sigman
Sigman, short hand for sigma notation, is a newly created project for calculating a sigma summation notation formula.

## DISCLAIMER - NOT PRODUCTION QUALITY CODE
This project is still in an early state, it has only been tested for integer-result iteration sigma formulas, and only uses JavaScript built-in data types, meaning that large values might cause unexpected results.
